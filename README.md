#About This project is a web framework with expressive and elegant syntax. I believe securing the data of users and also avoiding penetration and cross site scripting (XSS) should be taking into consideration when developing a website that will require the end-user information. Using the various techniques such, salting and hashing to prevent these mistakes really helps prevent unautorize users to have access to some sensitive info. Also proper monitoring of the activities that goes on the website is essential. It helps to detect both usual and unusual activities.
